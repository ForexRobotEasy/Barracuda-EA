Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product, but we provide this sample code to demonstrate how it can work as described in the product.

## Code Explanation
The code provided in this repository consists of various functions and settings that implement the trading algorithm for the Barracuda EA. Here is a brief explanation of the different sections of the code:

### Symbol and Timeframe Settings
The `symbol` and `timeframe` variables define the currency pair symbol and timeframe on which the EA will trade. In this example, the symbol is set to 'EURGBP' and the timeframe is set to 15 minutes.

### Risk Management Settings
The `riskPercentage` variable determines the percentage of capital to risk per trade. In this example, it is set to 2.0%.

### Initial Balance for Testing
The `initialBalance` variable represents the initial account balance used for testing purposes. In this example, it is set to 500.0.

### Net Profit Target
The `netProfitTarget` variable specifies the desired net profit target over a five-year period. In this example, it is set to 8431.0.

### Entry and Exit Conditions
The `ShouldEnterTrade()` and `ShouldExitTrade()` functions define the entry and exit conditions for the trades. These functions should be implemented by the user according to their trading strategy.

### Buy and Sell Order Execution
The `Buy()` and `Sell()` functions implement the execution of buy and sell orders, respectively. The user should implement their specific order execution logic within these functions.

### Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels
The `CalculateStopLoss()` and `CalculateTakeProfit()` functions calculate the stop-loss and take-profit levels for the trades. The user should implement their own calculations based on their trading strategy.

### Risk Management
The `CalculateLotSize()` function calculates the lot size based on the account balance and risk percentage. The user can modify this function to customize the lot size calculation.

### Trade Execution
The `ExecuteTrade()` function executes the trades based on the entry and exit conditions, order execution, stop-loss, and take-profit levels. It also checks if trades are allowed and closes all orders if the exit conditions are met.

### Error Handling and Exception Management
The `OnTradeError()` function handles trade errors and prints the error code and operation. Users can customize this function to handle errors according to their requirements.

### Testing and Verification
The `TestCode()` function is provided for users to implement their own testing code. Users can modify this function to test and verify the functionality of the code.

### Integration into Existing Barracuda EA Software
The `OnStart()` function is the main program loop that executes the `ExecuteTrade()` function. It also includes a sleep timer of 1 second before the next iteration. This function can be integrated into the existing Barracuda EA software.

### Logical Conclusion
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart or the terminal is closed. Users can implement their own deinitialization code within this function.
